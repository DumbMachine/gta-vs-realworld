# GTA vs Real World
This is a small proof of concept repo for testing if the visual features learnt from games like Grand Theft Auto Five, can be used in real life.
This repo is the supplement to the article [Gaming, A gold of dataset]()

I plan to make the dataset involved in the project, which is a gigantic 31 gigs of image data, public sometime in the future. I do not have the bandwidth to make uploading the dataset possilbe now.
